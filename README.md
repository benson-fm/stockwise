## Overview
One half of American adults report spending 5 hours or fewer outside in nature each week, with steady decline in recent years. Yet, research shows that connection to nature is essential to quality of life, health, and social well-being. Given this problem, we were inspired to create TrailQuest.

TrailQuest is a multi-featured AI-powered hiking gamification plaform that brings the fun to outdoor activities such as hiking and picnicking. TrailQuest strives to bring more people outside to embrace the full force of nature by introducing motivational systems inspired by popular video games. TrailQuests' gamification systems include a badge system, quests, and hunting for collectibles. By introducing these types of features, we expect more people to be influenced to partake in outdoor activities.

## Features
### Starting an Adventure
The user has a couple of ways to find a new hike: they can use our AI-suggestion search bar or use the saved and recent tabs to look at previous trails they looked at or liked.

Once the user picks the trail they want, our geographic map automagically centers on the trail that the user wants to hike and maps out the trail’s route. The user then starts a new hike which begins collecting statistics on their adventure. Along their hike, they have the opportunity to collect items throughout the course and add to a collection of collectibles they have obtained over their hiking career. This gives the hiker an incentive to complete trails and explore new areas. Each collectible also offers fun trivia about the animals they represent, growing the user’s audience of the nature that surrounds them.

### Other Perks
We have also provided an AI-powered suggestion copilot to help users plan their trips throughout their hiking career. Our copilot takes in what the user wants to do and lists other suggestions at their place of interest, tailored specifically to the user so they can experience unforgettable memories while on their trip.

### Badges and XP
Finally, our gamification system includes XP and levels which further motivates the user to participate in outdoor activities. Our XP system is based off the total amount of trails they complete and the total miles they walk. In addition, we have an integrated quest system that encourages the user to level up faster through partaking in daily challenges which grant additional XP. As your level gets higher, users begin to earn badges in a tiered approach starting from bronze to the ultimate tier of ruby. For true outdoors aficionados, we have incorporated a leaderboard system where top hikers are displayed for the world to see.
